red-black-tree-code.py manages a self-balancing red-black binary tree which allows search, insertion, and deletion in O(log n) time

machine.scm takes RML (an assembly language) code and interprets it in MIT Scheme (similar to Lisp) by creating a table which takes each register, operater, etc to its equivalent in Lisp. Then any line of RML code can be performed simply by "replacing" each part with its Lisp equivalent through table look-ups.
